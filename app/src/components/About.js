        Building a product is a
        wonderful thing, but too often the people who own the idea are left
        beind. As developers, we take you with us, working with you to define a
        solution. The more we work together, the better the product will be. And
        that is what makes us happy: building beautiful, well-thought-out and
        scalable products that delight users.
